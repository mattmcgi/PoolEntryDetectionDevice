# Sensor-to-Pi Bridge PCB

This PCB is a small **Raspberry Pi HAT** designed to facilitate communication between a sensor and the Raspberry Pi. The sensor my team is using is a **BlueRobotics Bar02**, which houses an **MS5837 pressure sensor**. This is the component that will actually communicate with the Pi.
