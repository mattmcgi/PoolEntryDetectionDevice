# Pool Entry Detection Device

My team's Senior Design project is a **wireless pool sensor** that detects when a person or object enters a pool and immediately sends a **push notification** to the user's phone. The system is designed to improve **safety and monitoring** for residential and commercial pools. 

Features:  
- **Real-time detection** of pool entry events  
- **Wireless communication** to a smartphone app  
- **Low-power operation** for continuous monitoring  
- **Alert system** to notify pool owners or caregivers instantly  

Technologies used:  
- Microcontroller-based sensor system  
- Wi-Fi connectivity
- Mobile push notifications  
- PCB design and embedded firmware development
